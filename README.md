This is a very simple and easy to use proxy that works for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.


This is an example for how to create a proxy within Java. It is very simple to use, just open this in IntelliJ and hit run.
Then go to your browser and set the proxy and type in the pc's ip in which you are using and put the port as 1151.
